# Alphaletter
Alphaletter is a word-based video game that features two players and takes inspiration from the Tapple.
I developed this game using C and the Raylib graphics library as a side project to see explore what I'll enjoy doing in software development.
I had tons of fun making this game and I'm likely to pursue another video game project!
